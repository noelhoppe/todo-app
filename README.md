## Learnings
During this project, I gained practical experience with a modern web application stack:
1. **FastAPI Fundamentals:** Built RESTful APIs using Python's FastAPI framework.
2. **React & TypeScript:** Developed a robust frontend with React and TypeScript for better type safety.
3. **ORM with SQLAlchemy:** Managed database models and queries using SQLAlchemy.
4. **Client-Side Routing:** Enabled smooth navigation with React Router.
5. **Data Fetching:** Used React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.
6. **UI Styling:** Combined Styled Components and Material UI for flexible and consistent UI design.
7. **JWT Authentication:** Secured the app with stateless JWT authentication and refresh token middleware.
8. **Password Security:** Protected user passwords by hashing them with bcrypt.
9. **Scalable Architecture:** Organized both the FastAPI backend and React frontend for maintainability and scalability.
10. **Deployment:** Deployed the application using Vercel, Render, and Supabase.
11. **Custom Domain:** I purchased my own domain (noeldev.me) and set it up for the project. Both the frontend and backend use dedicated subdomains. This approach ensures everything works correctly, since some browsersâ€”especially on mobile block third-party cookies. If the frontend and backend were on different domains, authentication could fail due to these restrictions.
